The Scottish arm of the British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA) held its ceremony on Sunday in Glasgow.Keep reading list of 4 itemslist 1 of 4As Israel pounds Gaza, BBC journalists accuse broadcaster of biaslist 2 of 4Indian police condemn BBC for article on media crackdown in Kashmirlist 3 of 4BBC Cairo staff on three-day strike over unequal paylist 4 of 4Rights groups to screen BBC film on Modi before White House visitend of list
At the event, some public figures used their moment on stage to express solidarity with Palestinians from the besieged enclave.
But they later found their words of support cut from the final edit of the show, which appeared on the British public service broadcaster‚Äôs streaming service, iPlayer.
Among those to accuse the BBC of censorship was director Eilidh Munro, who prevailed in BAFTA Scotland‚Äôs best Short Film and Animation category.
She used her acceptance speech to call on guests to ‚Äúuse your voice as filmmakers and artists‚Äù to lobby for a halt to Israel‚Äôs bombardment of Gaza, as her colleague Finlay Pretsell displayed a poster that read, ‚ÄúI refuse to be silent. Ceasefire now.‚Äù
While Munro‚Äôs entire award-winning segment, which included her acceptance speech, was seen by viewers watching the livestream version produced by BAFTA Scotland, it was not included in the final BBC iPlayer edit.
Munro told Scotland‚Äôs The National newspaper: ‚ÄúIt is deeply concerning that the BBC decided to cut the entire segment of our award acceptance speech from their coverage of the BAFTA Scotland Awards.
‚ÄúIt is also somewhat surreal that an event which celebrates artists and filmmakers for using their voices and creating work to speak out against injustice can also be censored.‚Äù
She added to The National: ‚ÄúIn my opinion, the BBC‚Äôs editorial decision to omit these peaceful signs of solidarity is neither neutral nor impartial.‚Äù

Apparently this was cut from the BBC coverage of the awards. Doubt they'd have done that if he was talking about Ukraine! https://t.co/idXBGWJepa

Pretsell‚Äôs poster is understood to have come from the campaigners who had gathered outside the ceremony‚Äôs venue at a Glasgow hotel.
Art Workers for Palestine Scotland¬†handed out pro-Palestinian paraphernalia to attendees, including Scotland‚Äôs Muslim First Minister Humza Yousaf.
Yousaf was seen at the event with his Scottish-Palestinian wife Nadia El-Nakla, whose parents escaped Gaza after becoming trapped in the Palestinian territory for weeks after the start of the bloody conflict.
Social media users outraged by the BBC edits have been sharing a video clip by the popular American TikTok user YourFavoriteGuy, who alleged the British broadcaster does not care ‚Äúabout [the Gazan] genocide or the Palestinians‚Äù.
More than 14,500 Palestinians in Gaza have been killed by Israeli air strikes in a matter of weeks. Israel‚Äôs bombardment began in retaliation for the Hamas attack on southern Israel nearly 50 days ago, during which about 1,200 Israelis were killed and more than 200 were taken hostage.
A truce is hoped to take hold early on Friday.
A BBC spokesperson told Al Jazeera that ‚Äúthe programme on iPlayer is a highlights show and therefore significantly shorter than the actual event itself‚Äù.
The spokesperson added: ‚ÄúSome edits were made so the content was compliant with BBC editorial guidelines on impartiality.‚Äù
According to those rules, which are published on the BBC‚Äôs website, the broadcaster ‚Äúmust be inclusive, considering the broad perspective and ensuring that the existence of a range of views is appropriately reflected. It does not require absolute neutrality on every issue or detachment from fundamental democratic principles, such as the right to vote, freedom of expression and the rule of law‚Äù.
