Analyst predicts an extended inter-communal violence in Israel
Violence between Palestinian citizens and Jewish Israelis has erupted following the police raid of Palestinian worshippers at Al Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem, and the inter-communal fighting could last for a while until the Israel government addresses the root cause of their conflict, a political analyst said.
“This is not going to be easy to put a stop and it could go on longer,” Mouin Rabani, co-editor of Al Jadaliyya magazine, said, predicting that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu faces a difficult task of putting an end to the polarisation.
“At this level and at this scope and duration, it certainly is unprecedented. I think it needs to be seen in the context of two factors: The first one is the almost 75 years of systematic dispossession, discrimination and racism by the state against Palestinians in Israel,” Rabani told Al Jazeera.
The second and more urgent issue is the defence of Al Aqsa Mosque and the Sheikh Jarrah issue, which have also left ordinary Palestinians looking after themselves amid the Israeli state’s “oppression”, Rabani said.

Intercommunal violence resumes
Violence between Palestinian citizens of Israel and Israeli Jews, seen on earlier days this week, has resumed.
In Bat Yam, a Tel Aviv suburb, a group of black-clad Israelis smashed the windows of an Arab-owned ice cream shop and Israeli ultranationalists could be seen chanting, “Death to Arabs!” on live television.
In the northern city of Tiberias, an amateur video uploaded to social media appeared to show a crowd of flag-waving Israelis attacking a car.
Israel’s Channel 13 quoted a senior police officer as saying Palestinian citizens of Israel are suspected of attacking and seriously wounding a Jewish man in Acre, also known as Akka.
Palestinian citizens of Israel say the violence of the past two days was not directed at Jews, but at Israeli nationalists with close ties to the settlement movement who have moved into mixed areas in recent years, pushing Arab residents out.
Al Jazeera’s Harry Fawcett said on Monday and Tuesday there was violence from both sides, but “the preponderance of it was Arab against Jew. Now it seems to be largely the other way round – a lot of Jewish attacks on Palestinian-Israelis in many mixed cities across the country”.

Calls for more action from Palestinian leadership
Human rights lawyer Noura Erakat called on Palestinian leaders to act as tensions continued to rise.
“Right now, we’re all paying attention because of the crisis, because of the confrontation, because settlers backed by the state, by the judiciary as well as the police are about to forcibly remove Palestinians from their homes in Sheikh Jarrah and set off across the boundaries separating Palestinians from one another,” she told Al Jazeera.
She said the Palestinian leadership has been “lacking in many respects”. “I think it has for a very long time failed to represent the Palestinian people adequately … Palestinian official leadership at this point should be pivoting to encourage diplomatic capitals to impose sanctions on Israel, to have a full front effort for accountability, to mobilise into a different discourse far from sitting down, peace mediation and instead towards justice, accountability and pressure.”

More Israeli attacks on Gaza
Reporting from Gaza, Al Jazeera’s Safwat al-Kahlout said more attacks from Israel targeted the besieged coastal enclave.
“The explosions can be heard everywhere. The streets in Gaza are empty except for ambulances which have been rushing in different directions. Unfortunately, they’re all carrying causalities,” said Kahlout.
“Israeli [forces] have been warning many families to evacuate and leave their homes which they will destroy later.
“The local Al Mizan human rights centre yesterday counted 16 houses that were destroyed by the Israelis. Today, at least another five have been destroyed,” he added.
Al-Kahlout said that tens of families were now homeless.
“Some have managed to stay with relatives or friends until they find a solution to the sudden crisis.”

Al Jazeera’s Nida Ibrahim, reporting from Ramallah in the occupied West Bank, said protests were set to take place in Ramallah about 9pm local time (18:00 GMT) in support of Palestinians in Gaza and East Jerusalem.
Ibrahim added the protests will also likely express growing anger towards the Palestinian Authority (PA).
The PA is holding its meeting at about 9:30pm local time, focusing on a diplomatic effort and trying to gain a stronger response from the international community to the recent escalation in violence.
Ibrahim said the mood in the West Bank is “frustrated at the Palestinian Authority. They say they don’t expect the meetings of the Palestinian Authority to take strong steps when it comes to the Israeli violations.”
“There has been a growing feeling among Palestinians that the Palestinian Authority is not being part of the solution, so it might be part of the problem.
PA defends its security cooperation as being part of the Oslo Accords signed with Israel, but many protesters in recent demonstrations have been chanting vociferously against the accords, said Ibrahim.

US blocks statement on Israel from UNSC
The UN Security Council held another emergency meeting on the worsening tensions between Israel and Palestinians, again without agreeing on a joint statement due to opposition from the United States, Israel’s key ally, according to diplomats.
The US saw the UNSC meeting as a sufficient show of concern, one diplomat told AFP on condition of anonymity.
“The US doesn’t see that a statement will help de-escalate,” said another.
According to sources, 14 of the 15 members of the Council were in favour of adopting a joint declaration aimed at reducing tension.

Israel building up military hardware at Gaza border
Al Jazeera’s Harry Fawcett, reporting from southern Israel, said Israel has been sending a significant volume of military hardware towards the border with Gaza, with the Israeli defence minister saying that this is an operation without an end date at the moment.
“That doesn’t mean that there is necessarily going to be a ground invasion – certainly there are significant risks as far as Israel is concerned, given how much it has already been able to do from the air,” Fawcett said.
“But we’ve seen a number of tracked vehicles, heavy artillery, and self-propelled howitzers being put into place on the back of flat-bed lorries, which have then been returning empty. So certainly there is preparation for a different phase, or at least a sign of a show of force.”

Parallel crisis unfolding in Israel’s mixed towns
Mairav Zonszein, a senior analyst on Israel and Palestine at the International Crisis Group, a think-tank, told Al Jazeera that the level of unrest and violence in mixed Israeli-Palestinian cities was “unprecedented”.
“This is a convergence of many different factors. Unfortunately, in some ways, the chickens have come home to roost. Israeli policies in mixed Israeli-Palestinian towns has never really been one of co-existence.
“There has been the same discrimination that you see in east Jerusalem happens inside Israel as well – in terms of housing policy discrimination, in rights, in all aspects of life, crime and negligence of the Israeli government – which Palestinian, Arab-Israeli parties have been calling out for years, asking for higher budgets, asking the police to rein in this violence. None of that has been happening, the government has neglected that,” explained Zonszein.

“What we are seeing is the result [of this] together with the convergence of what’s been happening in east Jerusalem and in Gaza.”
“Coexistence has always been an illusion – Israel has a policy of discrimination on all fronts,” she added.

Gaza hospital stretched to breaking point
Director of Al Shifa Hospital, Mohammed Abu Silmiya, told Al Jazeera Arabic that Israeli attacks on the Gaza Strip have put pressure on a medical system that was already stretched to the breaking point.
“The situation is more than dire, simply because the Gaza strip has been under a tight siege for the past 14 years, he said, explaining that both the siege and coronavirus pandemic have exhausted Gaza’s health sector.
“Israel’s recent unjust and belligerent aggression has added insult to injury.”
“Our operating rooms have been suffering from a lack of supplies over the past 15 years – medicines are in short supply in the entire Gaza strip. This hospital has been running on the same devices and appliances for the past 20 years,” said Abu Slimiya.

Right-wing Israeli politician calls a future Palestine ‘terror state’
In an interview with Al Jazeera, Naftali Bennett, leader of the right-wing Israeli Yamina party, said the creation of a Palestinian state would annihilate Israelis.
“It would create a terror state that does not exist yet in Judea and Samaria,” he said in reference to the occupied West Bank.
“It would effectively deem Israel unable to defend itself. We see what they [Palestinians] turned Gaza into. No Israeli is going to give up Judea and Samaria and allow them to create a terror state,” he added.
The former Israeli defence minister went on to call the West Bank “part and parcel of Israel”, adding that Palestinians living there should move to other Arab countries.
“The Arabs have tens of countries to live in,” said Bennet.

Ex-PLO member calls on international community to act
Hanan Ashrawi, a former leading member of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), called on the international community to end Israel’s “unbridled use of violence”.
“You have here an unbridled use of violence by the strongest army in the region targeting innocent civilians, targeting residential buildings in an area that has been totally closed in, besieged without any means of defence, with no air force, no shelters, with no sirens and at the same time the Israelis claim self-defence.”
“This is not new but this escalation is new. It has been emboldened by the Trump administration’s collusion, the Biden administration’s lack of action and the reticence of the Europeans so the question now is, do you allow Israel to target Jerusalem, to kick out Palestinians, the [third] highest holy site during Ramadan and to get away with it?”

Israeli air attack kills senior Hamas commander
Hamas, the group that rules the Gaza Strip, has confirmed that its Gaza City commander was killed in an Israeli air raid on Wednesday.
Bassem Issa is the highest-ranking military figure of Hamas to be killed by Israel since a 2014 war in Gaza.
In a statement, the armed wing of Hamas said Issa was killed “along with a few of his fellow brothers of leaders and holy fighters” during the fighting that has been going on for two days in Gaza.
Earlier, Israel’s internal security agency said a series of Israeli air raids had killed Issa and several other senior Hamas leaders.
Issa and several commanders responsible for the different districts of the Gaza Strip form the military council of Hamas, the highest body deciding the group’s operations.
Reporting from southern Israel, Al Jazeera’s Harry Fawcett said the killing of several top Hamas commanders in air attacks was a “significant blow” and Israeli premier Benjamin Netanyahu has promised more to follow.

Dozens of Palestinians were arrested at protests in other towns and cities within the Green Line, the generally recognised boundary between Israel and the West Bank.
In the central city of Lod, also known as Lydd, a state of emergency was declared for the first time in 66 years. Israeli authorities ordered the redeployment of paramilitary border police companies from the occupied West Bank as reinforcements.
Thousands of Palestinian citizens of Israel protested in the city after the funeral of Moussa Hassouneh, who was shot dead by a Jewish settler on Monday.
The crowd fought with police and set a synagogue and some 30 vehicles on fire, Israeli media reported.

Is the Palestinian Authority being sidelined?

The Palestinian Authority (PA) and Palestinian Liberation Organisation (PLO) executive committee are set to meet on Wednesday night in Ramallah to discuss the Israeli escalation in the Gaza Strip.
“We’ve spoken to a PLO executive committee member who told us that the language the international community has been using is not strong enough to curb the Israeli violations,” Al Jazeera’s Nida Ibrahim said, speaking from Ramallah.
Ibrahim said that for many Palestinians, the usual track the PA resorts to in times of escalation of appealing to the international community to condemn Israel is not enough.
“There’s a growing feeling among Palestinians that Israel only understands the language of force, which is why we’ve seen in the protests in the occupied West Bank in the past few days people calling on Gaza [armed groups] to respond,” she said.
