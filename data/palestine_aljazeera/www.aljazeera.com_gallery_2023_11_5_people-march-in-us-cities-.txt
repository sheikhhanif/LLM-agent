The demonstrators in Washington, DC on Saturday directed their anger towards President Joe Biden, accusing him of enabling genocide against Palestinians.
“Biden, Biden, you can’t hide; we charge you with genocide,” the protesters chanted.
United Nations experts have warned of a growing risk of genocide in Gaza amid Israel’s relentless bombardment of the enclave, which was launched in response to Hamas’s October 7 attacks on southern Israeli communities.
Protesters have also rallied in Indonesia and Pakistan calling for an end to Israeli strikes on Gaza.
