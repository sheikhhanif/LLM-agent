Israel accepted an Egyptian proposal on Tuesday morning for a ceasefire to end the fighting in Gaza, which began on July 8 and has killed at least 208 Palestinians and injured more than 1,500 others. Hamas, which rules the Gaza Strip, said it was never consulted about the ceasefire and rejected it. Hours later, Israel resumed its bombardment.
Thousands of Gaza residents have since fled their homes in search of safety and shelter in United Nations shelters. Adnan Abu Hassna, spokesman for the UN Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA), said the agency has turned eight of its schools into temporary shelters.
At least 16,000 Palestinians have now sought refuge in United Nation schools, according to UN figures. 
UN relief officials indicated that many women and children have been among the more than 200 killed and more than 1,500 wounded in Israeli airstrikes.A Palestinian family breaks its day-long Ramadan fast at a UN school in Gaza City.Four-year-old Palestinian girl Shayma Al-Masri lies on a bed next to her doll as she receives treatment at a hospital in Gaza City.
