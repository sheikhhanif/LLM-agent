WAFA also reported that a separate Israeli air strike targeted a residential building in the Tal al-Hawa neighbourhood southwest of Gaza City.
An Israeli aircraft was also reported to have struck homes in the vicinity of the Al-Quds Hospital, which is affiliated with the Red Crescent Society and located west of Gaza City.
There were no immediate reports on casualties for both strikes.

“The council should not accept this,” the Jordanian envoy said.
“Isn’t it time for the council to say to Israel that human life is sacred, regardless of someone’s religion, ethnicity or origin?”

“They see that the humanitarian situation in Gaza is utter devastation, and not by accident as a result of the war, but by design,” Baddar told Al Jazeera.
“Israeli politicians have been quite explicit about the fact that they have deliberately cut off water, food and electricity to the entire civilian population. This is a war crime,” he said.
“They [the Israeli government] are intent on proceeding as if nothing is happening as long as they have the backing of the US. And unfortunately, that looks like it remains intact.”

In recent days, the Lebanese armed group and Israel have launched attacks deeper into each other’s territory, an escalation from previous skirmishes confined to the Israel-Lebanon border region.
“I really hope that an all-out war doesn’t start because then it will never stop,” said Elie Khoury, 30, from his phone shop in Beirut. “We won’t be able to handle it [economically]. We don’t even have enough medications and there is a shortage of needles in the hospitals.”

During the last hour, a residential building was flattening right where we are in Khan Younis city. Another residential house was destroyed … in the south of Rafah district.
The attacks also continued relentlessly around the Al-Aqsa Hospital, which led to the shutting [down] of electricity in the region.

It’s also important to mention that this hospital contains thousands of Palestinians who were displaced from their houses; they considered this place to be a safe shelter for them.

“They are besieged and bombed with nowhere safe to go,” the Palestinian UN envoy said during the emergency meeting on the situation in Gaza.
“How many more days will you wait to say, ‘enough’? Paralysed, not acting, not carrying out your duty to maintain international peace and security and to stop that war,” Mansour said to the council members, urging an immediate ceasefire.
live-orange30 Oct 2023 - 21:55 (21:55 GMT)UK Conservative MP sacked from ministerial aide role for Gaza ceasefire callA British member of parliament has been sacked from his government role as a parliamentary private secretary after he called for a ceasefire in Gaza.
Paul Bristow, who is the Conservative MP for Peterborough, had said that a ceasefire would “save lives and allow for a continued column of humanitarian aid” to reach civilians, in a letter to British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak delivered last week.
The British government is opposed to a ceasefire – despite the continued loss of life in Gaza – and a spokesperson for Sunak said that Bristow had been removed from his position because he had not backed the government’s decision.
The leadership of both the ruling Conservative Party and the main opposition Labour Party have refused to call for a ceasefire, but dissent has been emerging from members of parliament and councillors, particularly within left-wing Labour.
A Labour MP was also suspended on Monday for using the phrase “between the river and the sea” at a pro-Palestinian rally.
Supporters of Israel have attempted to police the usage of the phrase, which calls for freedom for Palestinians between the Mediterranean Sea and the Jordan River.
McDonald’s own usage of the term included a reference to both “Israelis and Palestinians, between the river and the sea”, living in “peaceful liberty”.

First, when it comes to the mounting civilian casualties – the spokespeople coming out and saying this is not Israel’s fault, they’re doing all they can to avoid civilians. They blame Hamas, saying Hamas hides among civilian targets.
On aid, they don’t talk about the absolute desperate situation that the millions of Palestinians find themselves in. Instead, they are choosing to promote their efforts. They say they were able to get the Israelis to lift the blackout on communications, that they’ve been able to get the Israelis to reopen one line of freshwater into Gaza.
They say they’re working on trying to get up to 100 aid trucks into Gaza through Egypt a day, so they’re trying to focus on that.
But on the question of [a] ceasefire, National Security Council spokesman John Kirby made clear just hours ago that there is absolutely no daylight between the US and Israel on this.

David Barnea made the trip after Israel began expanding its ground operations in Gaza on Thursday, an escalation in the conflict that came after a source had told Al Jazeera that Qatar had been getting closer to mediating a prisoner swap between Israel and Hamas.
Axios said that Barnea had resumed the talks on the captives while in Qatar, adding that sources had said that the discussions were “positive and constructive”, but hadn’t led to “a breakthrough”.
Al Jazeera reached out to the Qatari Foreign Ministry for comment but has yet to receive a response.

live-orange30 Oct 2023 - 21:05 (21:05 GMT)What is the UAE’s position on Gaza at the UN Security Council?The United Arab Emirates, which called for today’s emergency UN Security Council meeting on Gaza, is working on another draft resolution pushing for a ceasefire in the besieged Palestinian territory.
The Gulf country is a top United States ally in the region and has been improving its ties with Israel over the past several years, including by bolstering communications and security ties. In 2020, the UAE signed a so-called “normalisation” deal with Israel, known as the Abraham Accords – and has worked to grow ever closer to Israel.
But amid the war in Gaza, the UAE has been taking an increasingly critical line at the UN, as Arab public opinion hardens against Israel in light of the civilian suffering in Gaza.
“It is interesting that the UAE is taking this position, but the UAE is not just acting as the UAE,” Al Jazeera’s diplomatic editor, James Bays, explained.
“The UAE is the current Arab member of the Security Council, so they are the one acting on behalf of the Arab countries in this regard.”
Last week, Abu Dhabi voted in favour of a Russia-led Security Council resolution urging a ceasefire in Gaza while voting against a competing, US-led resolution that had called for a humanitarian pause in the fighting.
live-orange30 Oct 2023 - 21:00 (21:00 GMT)If you’re just joining usIt is 11pm (21:00 GMT) in the Palestinian territories and Israel, and here are the latest developments:

More than 420 children are being killed or injured in the Gaza Strip every day, says Catherine Russell, executive director of the UN’s children’s fund.
WHO says it has not been able to resupply two hospitals in northern Gaza, Al-Shifa and Al-Quds hospitals, because the United Nations deemed the level of risk unacceptable.
The Palestine Red Crescent has said 26 trucks with humanitarian aid have entered the Gaza Strip through the Rafah border crossing with Egypt; no fuel has been allowed in.
In a televised address, Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant says Hamas has “two options” – either to “die fighting or to surrender without any conditions”.
Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu has rejected any calls for a ceasefire or cessation of hostilities with Hamas.
The Turkish-Palestinian Friendship Hospital has suffered severe damage in a new Israeli air attack.

live-orange30 Oct 2023 - 20:50 (20:50 GMT)Turkey decries attack on hospital in southern GazaTurkey has denounced an Israeli attack on Gaza’s Turkish-Palestinian Friendship Hospital, saying there is “no explanation” for such an attack.
In a statement, the Turkish foreign ministry said it had shared all of the “necessary information, including the coordinates of the institution in question” with Israel before the attack.
The hospital is the only cancer hospital in the enclave, it said.
“The siege and these inhumane attacks, which aim to deprive the Palestinian people in Gaza of their most basic rights, clearly violate international law,” the statement read.
Earlier on Monday, the Palestinian Interior Ministry said parts of the hospital were damaged after it was hit in an Israeli air strike.
live-orange30 Oct 2023 - 20:40 (20:40 GMT)Ceasefire not the answer, says White House, despite rising civilian death tollThe US does not believe a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas is currently “the right answer”, says National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby.
The official was asked in a White House briefing about the US position on a ceasefire, after it voted against a UN General Assembly resolution calling for humanitarian pauses on Friday.
“We do not believe that a ceasefire is the right answer right now,” Kirby said. “We believe that a ceasefire right now benefits Hamas, and Hamas is the only one that would gain from that right now.”
Israeli attacks have killed more than 8,000 Palestinians since October 7, almost half of them children, and the number of dead is expected to rapidly rise as Israel expands its ground operations in Gaza.
Kirby said that instead of a ceasefire, the US administration was pushing for “temporary, localised humanitarian pauses for aid, and for people to get out”.

“The true cost of this latest escalation will be measured in children’s lives,” she told the UN Security Council.
“In the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, at least 37 children have reportedly been killed. More than 30 Israeli children have reportedly been killed, while at least 20 children remain hostage in the Gaza Strip, their fate unknown.
“The situation grows worse by the hour,” Russell warned. “And without an end to the hostilities, I am afraid for the fate of the region’s children.”
She called on the Security Council to “immediately” adopt a resolution that:

calls for a ceasefire,
demands the parties allow safe and unimpeded humanitarian access, and
demands the immediate safe release of all abducted children.

It is now working to curb its loses, sources familiar with the group’s thinking told Reuters news agency, following Israeli drone attacks.
Hezbollah had made “arrangements to reduce the number of martyrs”, a source said, without offering further details.
Among its tactics is the use of anti-aircraft missiles, one source noted.
On Sunday, Hezbollah unveiled its surface-to-air missile capability. The missiles are part of an increasingly potent arsenal.

“Some 9,000 cancer patients are not receiving adequate care,” she told the UN Security Council, expressing concern over the Israeli military’s warnings to evacuate healthcare facilities in the besieged enclave.
“There is nowhere safe for these patients to go, and for those on life support and babies on incubators, moving will certainly be a death sentence.”

“Now, civilians remaining in the north are receiving evacuation notices from the Israeli forces, urging them south to receive scarce humanitarian assistance. But many, including pregnant women, people with disabilities, the sick and the wounded, are unable to move,” he said.
“What happened and continues to happen is forced displacement.”
Lazzarini added that hundreds of thousands of forcibly displaced Palestinians in Gaza are living in “appalling” conditions, with limited food and water.
“Hunger and despair are turning into anger against the international community and in Gaza, the international community is better known as UNRWA.”

Izzat al-Rishq, a member of the Hamas political bureau, said that “no one believed” the Israeli government’s narrative, not even Israelis themselves.
For his part, Hamas spokesperson Abdul Latif al-Qanou said that the presence of Israeli tanks on the outskirts of Gaza City earlier on Monday was a “photo opportunity to restore the prestige of their army”.
Al-Qanou said that only a limited number of Israeli tanks had entered Gaza, under the cover of aircraft and tank fire.

“It’s a disaster on top of a disaster. Health needs are soaring and our ability to meet those needs is rapidly declining,” said Rick Brennan, WHO’s regional emergencies director, adding a ceasefire was needed to enable a larger humanitarian operation.
A third of Gaza’s hospitals and 71 percent of clinics are nonfunctioning, he said.
WHO is continuing to resupply hospitals and clinics in southern Gaza, but relief delivered so far overall in the Strip is a “drop in the ocean”, Brennan added.

It’s unclear what exactly was happening, but Colin Clarke, director of research at the Soufan Group, speculated that the explosions could have been Israeli bombs targeting Hamas tunnels.
“This could be the use of bunker busters, where the Israelis are dropping bombs meant to penetrate what we call hard and deeply buried targets, in an effort to target Hamas’s underground combat spaces, and underground infrastructure, with an explosion that loud it could be designed to penetrate hundreds of feet into the earth,” Clarke told Al Jazeera, with the caveat that it was impossible to be certain.

“Who is organising the deadly chaos and who benefits from it today, in my opinion, has already become obvious … It is the current ruling elites of the US and their satellites who are the main beneficiaries of world instability,” said Putin, whose own Russian forces have been involved in bombing Syrian opposition forces for years.
He added that the death of innocent people could not be justified, and that the key to resolving the conflict was the creation of a Palestinian state.
Putin also blamed Ukraine and Western nations for the storming of an airport in the Russian republic of Dagestan on Sunday by protesters, after a flight from Israel was scheduled to land.

The human rights group is referring to a supplementary US funding bill that proposes providing additional humanitarian aid to Palestinians who have been displaced from the besieged enclave to neighbouring countries.
DAWN warned in a statement that “Israeli actions, statements and policy directives, including a leaked policy document drafted by the Israeli intelligence ministry that recommends the permanent forced transfer of Palestinians in Gaza to Sinai, indicate that Israel is actively considering forcibly displacing Palestinians in Gaza to third countries.”
The group’s executive director, Sarah Leah Whitson, added: “Both by word and by deed, Israeli officials are pursuing a broader strategy to permanently remove Palestinians from their native lands, and counting on the US to pay for it.
“Congress should vote against any aid package that could support these acts, which amount to violations of human rights and grave breaches of the laws of war.”

“The third floor, which is for administering anesthesia, was directly hit by Israeli shelling, which destroyed walls, windows, oxygen tank lines, water pipes and electricity lines, said Sobhi Skeik, director of the Turkish-Palestinian Friendship Hospital.
There were no patients or medical team on that floor during that time.
“The hit took place at 5:30pm local time [15:30 GMT] but since yesterday, the environs of the hospital have been getting repeatedly struck by Israeli shelling,” he said.
In Gaza, there are 10,000 cancer patients. The hospital only has 156 beds, in addition to 100 beds for daily use, Skeik explained.
“We are worried that the hospital will be struck again and that our patients will get killed in their beds, and we are worried about the wellbeing of our staff, but we will continue to do our work. This is our duty.”

“There is no third option,” Gallant said, directing his message to “fighters on the ground as well as the leadership” in Gaza.
“We will reach them and we will achieve our mission and we will ensure the organisation is no longer there,” he said. “We will succeed in our ground operation by ensuring the return of our captives and by dismantling Hamas’s capabilities.”
His remarks come as Israel continues to pound various parts of the enclave despite widespread calls for an immediate ceasefire.

That brings the Israeli death toll since Hamas’s attack on October 7 to 1,405, including 315 military personnel and 58 police officers.
Israeli daily Haaretz has published the names of the soldiers, citing the Israeli army. They are:

Hamas has yet to comment.
Netanyahu “congratulated” the Israeli military and the Shin Bet, and said that the state remained committed to releasing all of those held captive in Gaza – as he faces pressure from the families of those captives, some of whom feel that the government is not doing enough.
The prime minister earlier told his war cabinet that Israeli forces were making “systematic progress” in the fight against Hamas.

“Israeli public opinion is divided between those who think Israel should pay any price – for Gilad Shalit, Israel released 1,000 Hamas prisoners, including [Hamas leader] Ismail Haniyeh,” Eldar told Al Jazeera, referring to Shalit, an Israeli soldier who was taken captive by Hamas in 2006, and released in 2011 in a prisoner swap.
“On the other hand … in his press conference, Netanyahu – when he was asked about the Gilad Shalit deal – he admitted that it was a mistake and said he would review this [prisoner swap] policy again,” Eldar added.
Eldar said that there was a “paradox” between the message coming from the Israeli government that destroying Hamas would be a priority, and the message that securing the release of the captives would be a priority.
“Every day the fighting goes on, the chance to get [the captives] out gets smaller,” Eldar said.

Semantics aside, the not-quite-big and not-quite-rapid move that has been going on in recent days is a step up from the previous two quick in-and-out night-time incursions. But not an all-out invasion.
Soldiers call this reconnaissance-in-force. In preparation for an offensive, smaller units attack to probe the positions, strength, tactics and operational readiness of their foes. Initial battle plans are then adapted using the knowledge obtained.
Even so, Israel’s ground advance looks timid: it is smaller and slower than the big push the ministers and generals boasted about.
Some pundits may see it as a sign that the Israeli army lacks sufficient weapons reserves. But that cannot be, because it is continuing relentless aerial bombing and long-distance shelling of Gaza that has not abated for more than three weeks now, causing massive indiscriminate casualties.

Since 2007, when the blockade was placed, Israel has waged six wars: In 2008, 2012, 2014, 2021, 2022 and 2023.
2008: Israeli forces raided Gaza to kill Hamas fighters. That led to Operation Cast Lead, a weeks-long assault on Gaza involving aerial bombing and a ground invasion. At least 1,000 Palestinians and 12 Israelis died. It also caused severe damage to housing, businesses and electrical infrastructure in Gaza.
2012: Israel launched eight days of air strikes and killed the head of Hamas’s military wing. Almost 180 people were killed.
2014: Israel carried out air strikes and artillery bombardment that devastated Gaza neighbourhoods. More than 2,100 Palestinians were killed, mostly civilians. Israel put the number of its dead at 67 soldiers and six civilians.
2021: Another major outbreak of violence occurred after Israel threatened to evict Palestinian families from their homes in the Sheikh Jarrah neighbourhood of occupied East Jerusalem — and Israeli police imposed restrictions on the Al-Aqsa Mosque during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. Israel carried out air strikes on the Gaza Strip, killing more than 250 there.
2022: Three days of Israeli bombardment on Gaza killed at least 44 Palestinians, including 15 children.
2023: On October 7, Hamas launched an attack on Israel, killing at least 1,400 people and taking more than 200 hostages back to Gaza, according to Israeli figures. Israel promised to destroy Hamas, imposing a full siege on Gaza and hammering it with air strikes.
Medical authorities in Gaza say more than 8,300 people have been killed in Israel’s bombardment, including more than 3,400 children. Israeli troops backed by tanks pressed into the Palestinian enclave with a ground assault.

She made this live broadcast from inside her building as explosions from Israeli air attacks were going off all around her.
The phone call that we received was from a private number. The caller addressed my husband with his full name and told him that “This is the Israeli army, we are telling you to evacuate south because in the coming hours it is going to be very dangerous in the area where you are at.”
My husband told him that we know there were tanks is Salah al-Din Street, that’s the main street linking northern Gaza to the south, and he said, “I can’t answer you on which route you would take but the main street could be relatively safer, you should find out yourself but you need to move now”.
In the midst of all this bombardment, I don’t know how safe it would be to actually take our car and leave and drive under this heavy bombardment. It’s very risky, it doesn’t seem safe at all; in the past days, we’ve been seeing videos of cars that were directly targeted while they were on the street going to the south.
So it’s really a very tense situation, I don’t think that if I risk my life and the life of my kids to take this journey that this could be a right decision. And at the same time, they called us directly and warned us telling us to leave now but the bombardment is relentless, how are people like me and others are going to be able to leave? I don’t know what options we have right now.
There are seven families overall in this building. Some of them have their relatives living with them as well, so there are about 100 people in this building. None of the other six families got a warning call from the Israeli military, like we did, so this was a direct threat just to us, to our family.

Israeli tanks have taken positions on the southern outskirts of Gaza City. They are in an area with trees and vegetation, and they are clearing them. We can hear the sounds of explosions and heavy gunfire in the distance.
At the moment, the Israeli tanks are not advancing towards the western part of Gaza City, where the second major road linking Gaza City to the rest of the Strip is located.
Many people have received calls from the Israelis, telling them to leave. At the moment, not many are doing that because when they did earlier, they were fired upon by Israeli forces.

live-orange30 Oct 2023 - 11:10 (11:10 GMT)Analysis: What is Israel’s military strategy in Gaza?Zoran KusovacReports of tanks accompanied by an armoured bulldozer reaching Salah ad-Din Street south of Gaza City could mean that Israel has, for the first time, conducted daylight armoured reconnaissance to identify Hamas’s defensive positions and their response capabilities.
Limiting operations to open farmland or desert would be the least costly way for the Israeli army to maintain a presence in part of Gaza because that’s where its superiority in armour, artillery and air cover benefits it and it can avoid bloody urban warfare.
Should it decide to attack Gaza City, it would have to use enough soldiers to reach the city limits and dig in, which will draw most Hamas fighters to the city. A follow-on combined attack, with armoured forces advancing from the east and naval infantry from the sea, might succeed in what is being hypothesised now, that it is trying to cut the Strip in half.
The corridor, 6km long from the sea to the border and up to 2km wide from the outskirts of Gaza City to al-Mughraqa would be militarily defensible and a useful asset in any negotiations.

“This shows that Hezbollah is starting a new phase in challenging the Israeli army and stepping up in this war, instead of keeping the fire exchange within 2-4km,” military expert Elijah Magnier told Al Jazeera.
“In response, Israel bombed deeper inside Lebanon territory to hit the source of the launch because it cannot afford to have its eyes [the drones] in the sky targeted.”
For the past three weeks, skirmishes between Israel and Hezbollah have remained restrained in scope and geography, mostly targeting isolated areas close to the border. But experts say both sides now seem to be widening their target areas.
On Sunday, rockets fired by Hezbollah reached the northern city of Kiryat Shmona, hitting one home, according to Israeli media.

Here are the latest developments:

The Israeli tanks approaching the outskirts of Gaza City have now retreated, according to the head of the Hamas government office in Gaza. The tanks had reached Salah al-Din Street, a distance of about 3km (1.86 miles) from the Gaza fence.
The Palestinian Red Crescent says intense Israeli air raids are taking place in Gaza’s Tal al-Hawa area, where the al-Quds Hospital is located. Despite Israeli orders to evacuate the facility, the hospital administration says it is impossible to do so as most of the patients are elderly and have disabilities.
An Israeli raid in the city of Jenin in the occupied West Bank has killed at least four people and wounded five.
Israeli media say three rockets attacks, confirmed by Hamas, took place in the southern Israeli city of Netivot.
The UN Security Council is scheduled to meet today and discuss Israel’s massive operation in Gaza as well as the dire humanitarian situation on the ground.
According to an internal US State Department document, tens of thousands of people in Gaza, including pregnant women and babies, are drinking salty and contaminated water, the Israeli newspaper Haaretz reported.
Save the Children says more children have now been killed in Gaza in the last three weeks than the total killed in conflicts around the world in every year since 2019.

A short while ago, Israel started the second phase of its war on Gaza. A large number of tanks moved in from the southeastern part of Gaza, advancing towards the west.
They are now close to a junction that connects various parts of Gaza. If they reach and take control of the junction, they will effectively divide the south and north of Gaza, significantly hampering the movement of people.
Israeli forces issued a warning instructing people not to travel between the south and north of Gaza. Sources have also reported tanks moving from the northern part of Gaza towards Gaza City.
We are currently unable to contact individuals in Gaza City, as the Israelis have cut off communication. Phone and internet services have been disabled.

It is worth noting that British PM Rishi Sunak visited Israel earlier this month to express his support for its military campaign on Gaza which has so far killed more than 8,000 people.
On Friday, the UK also voted against a UN General Assembly resolution calling for a humanitarian ceasefire leading to a cessation of hostilities.

The tactics being used by Hezbollah are evolving. Yesterday, rockets launched from southern Lebanon landed deeper inside Israel, no longer confined to the two or three-kilometre range near the border. Israel has also targeted areas deeper inside Lebanon.
We also witnessed an attack targeting an Israeli settlement. The fact that a settlement was targeted instead of a military position is significant.
Hezbollah deployed a new weapon, a ground-to-air missile, that successfully targeted an Israeli drone, according to the group.
During the first three weeks of the escalation, Hezbollah suffered a high number of casualties. Since Friday, it has only announced the deaths of two fighters. It is not clear whether this change in tactics aims to avoid heavy casualties or if it represents an escalation in the conflict.

The satellite internet venture operated by SpaceX is comprised of a “constellation of thousands of satellites” that orbit very close to Earth at about 550km (340 miles) from the surface, making it easier to provide internet services in rural and isolated regions of the world where the internet terminals and cables aren’t strong.
SpaceX CEO Musk initially responded to a post calling for Starlink support for Gaza, saying that it wasn’t clear who had authority for ground links in the besieged enclave and that “no terminals from Gaza have attempted to communicate with our constellation”.
After the calls for Musk to support communications in Gaza through Starlink gained momentum, he announced “Starlink will support connectivity to internationally recognised aid organizations in Gaza”.

We understand that Israeli forces are still present inside the Jenin refugee camp.
Pictures have emerged showing military-grade bulldozers very close to a hospital and others destroying civilian properties.
In previous raids, there was a clear focus on particular buildings, often homes suspected of belonging to Hamas fighters, members, or supporters. However, overnight in Jenin, we did not witness this focus. This situation appears different, and it has continued for more than six hours.
According to health officials, there have been at least four deaths and many injuries. Dozens have been arrested by Israeli forces.

No fuel deliveries, however, have been made despite pleas from hospitals, which have been mostly operating on power generators after electricity to the territory was cut down by Israel.
To date, 117 trucks have entered Gaza through the crossing since limited deliveries resumed to the crowded Palestinian territory of more than 2.3 million people, according to the AFP news agency.
Before the siege, some 500 trucks carrying aid and other goods entered Gaza every day.

Israeli bombardment of Gaza has continued throughout the night, with a particular focus on the north of the enclave where Israeli forces appear to be attempting to advance. Dozens of Palestinians have been killed in the Israeli attacks and the total number of Palestinians killed is now above 8,000 since October 7.
“Significant damage” has been reported to the Turkish-Palestinian Friendship Hospital in Gaza, following Israeli attacks on nearby targets, according to the director of the hospital – the only medical centre in the enclave that can handle cancer patients.
Further Israeli attacks have also taken place in the al-Saftawi area of northern Gaza, killing at least 16 people, and dozens are feared to have been killed or injured in Jabalia after a house was hit.
An Israeli raid in the occupied West Bank city of Jenin has killed at least one Palestinian. A possible drone attack has also reportedly taken place in the latest Israeli raid, part of an ongoing campaign that predates the Israel-Hamas war but has intensified since the conflict began.
As settler attacks continue in the occupied West Bank, the head of the Israeli Shin Bet domestic security agency has warned that there could be an “eruption” of violence as a result, Israeli media has reported.

live-orange30 Oct 2023 - 02:15 (02:15 GMT)Can an ‘all-for-all’ swap happen?Alan FisherReporting from occupied East JerusalemThere is pressure on the Israeli government not to continue with a full-scale ground war in Gaza, because many people believe that could put the people being held captive at risk.
We’ve certainly heard from Hamas … that 50 of those being held captive have already died in the intense bombardment that we’ve seen over the last several days.
And that’s why many people think that this ground war that everyone was expecting hasn’t been as big, as intense or as extensive, because the Israeli government is concerned that it would put the lives of those being held captive more at risk.
Hamas has said that it would like to do an “all-for-all” swap, essentially swapping all the captives for all the Palestinian prisoners being held in Israeli jails.
But Israel’s Defence Minister Yoav Gallant has said that he doesn’t believe that Hamas really wants that, even though the group has said that it does.

“When you have 14,000 people in the hospital, many in critical situations where they can’t be moved, an evacuation order doesn’t suffice,” Roth told Al Jazeera.
“It is wrong to suggest that whatever military advantage coming from hitting the supposed Hamas facility underneath would justify the disproportionate harm to civilians,” he added.
While stressing that he believed Hamas also committed war crimes by attacking Israeli civilians, Roth said the actions of the armed group do not justify Israel’s decision to bomb civilians in Gaza.
“Under international humanitarian law, war crimes by one side do not justify war crimes by the other. Each side has an independent obligation to respect the laws of war,” said Roth, who is now a visiting professor at Princeton University.
