What history tells us about Palestine and IsraelIn this episode of UpFront, we look back at the history and context leading up to the current Israel-Gaza warRead moreNearly two months after the October 7 attack by Hamas, Israel’s response has killed more than 14,500 Palestinians.
While many see the current conflict as a reaction to the attack that killed 1,200 people in Israel, others have pointed out that this view ignores crucial historical context and that the conflict has been ongoing for generations.
Following the 1917 Balfour Declaration which led to an influx of Jewish immigrants, the creation of Israel in 1948 saw an enormous displacement of Palestinians, in addition to the expulsion of hundreds of thousands who remain refugees to this day.
On UpFront, Mustafa Barghouti, the co-founder of the Palestinian National Initiative, and author Ghada Karmi, join Marc Lamont Hill to look back at the history of Palestine and contextualise the current war.
