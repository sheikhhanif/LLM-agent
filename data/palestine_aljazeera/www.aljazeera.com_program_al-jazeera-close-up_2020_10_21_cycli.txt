Alaa al-Dali, 23, lives in Gaza and was once one of the fastest Palestinian road cyclists.
Despite training up and down on that road every day for years, he was always refused permission to travel when selected to compete in international competitions.Keep reading list of 4 itemslist 1 of 4Denmark’s Vingegaard claims second straight Tour de France winlist 2 of 4Swiss cyclist dies after fall into ravine during Tour de Suisselist 3 of 4Pushing for women’s race, group tackles Tour de Francelist 4 of 4Riding, despite Gazaend of list
The road where Alaa and his local team train is the longest of the besieged enclave. The 36km (22 miles) path is hemmed in by the Eretz wall in the north (Israeli border) and by Rafah crossing (Egypt border) in the south.
Alaa says he was shot while he was peacefully watching The Great March of Return protests close to the Israel-Gaza border fence when he was shot in his right leg by an Israeli sniper.
What followed was a journey of a young man trying to come to terms with a life-altering injury while keeping his lifelong ambition of representing Palestine on the world stage alive.
This documentary follows Alaa’s new struggle to be a para-cyclist under the crushing conditions of the Israeli blockade of Gaza and his determination to persevere and hope.
