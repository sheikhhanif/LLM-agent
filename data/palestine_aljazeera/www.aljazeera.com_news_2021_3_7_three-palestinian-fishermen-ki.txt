Translation: The Ministry of Interior and National Security is investigating the death of three fishermen following an explosion in their boat off the coast of Khan Younis, in the south of the Gaza Strip, on Sunday morning.
The Israeli military has denied responsibility for the incident.
“The [Israeli military] is not responsible for the incident, and our indications show that their deaths were caused by an explosion inside Gaza,” it said in a statement.
WAFA news agency reported that the Israeli navy had earlier on Sunday opened fire at Palestinian fishermen sailing off Gaza city, forcing the boat to return to shore.
Israel has maintained a blockade on the Gaza Strip since 2007. It imposes tight restrictions on the work of fishermen off the coast of the Gaza Sea, citing security reasons.
Gaza has approximately 3,000 fishermen, of whom only 800 work on some 700 boats. Some 70,000 Palestinians in Gaza make a living directly or indirectly from fishing, according to official Palestinian statistics.
