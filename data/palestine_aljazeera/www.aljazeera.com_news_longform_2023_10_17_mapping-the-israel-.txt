November 1 - 4

Israel carried out deadly air raids on the Jabalia refugee camp in recent days, killing more than 200 people. It also targeted several medical facilities, including the vicinity of al-Quds and al-Shifa hospitals, and a school hosting displaced people in the Saftawi neighbourhood.
The Israeli army said it had “completed the encirclement of the city of Gaza” amid reports of violent clashes between Palestinian fighters and Israeli forces in Gaza City.
Some foreign passport holders and injured Palestinians have been allowed out of Gaza for the first time since the war began, crossing to Egypt through the Rafah checkpoint.
The death toll in the occupied West Bank since October 7 now stands at 145, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health. Israeli raids continued across the occupied territory in the towns of Nablus, Jenin, Hebron and Bethlehem.
Rockets fired from southern Lebanon caused widespread damage in the northern Israeli city of Kiryat Shmona on November 2, as skirmishes on the Israel-Lebanon border intensified.

Understanding the besieged Gaza Strip
The Palestinian enclave - home to some 2.3 million people - has been under an Israeli air, land and sea blockade since 2007. The Gaza Strip comprises five governorates: North Gaza, Gaza City, Deir el-Balah, Khan Younis and Rafah.
North Gaza extends for 10km (6 miles) and shares the only crossing into Israel through Beit Hanoon, also known as the Erez crossing. North Gaza is home to the Jabalia refugee camp, the largest in the Gaza Strip.
Gaza City is the largest and most populous city within the Strip, with more than 750,000 residents. At the heart of the Rimal neighbourhood is Shifa Hospital – the largest medical facility in the Gaza Strip.
Deir el-Balah is one of Gaza’s largest agricultural producers. It has a population of 320,000 and is home to four refugee camps: Nuseirat, Al Bureij, Al Maghazi and Deir el-Balah.
Khan Younis is home to some 430,000 people. At its centre is the Khan Younis refugee camp, where about 90,000 people live.
Rafah is the southernmost district of Gaza with a population of about 275,000. Rafah is also the name of the crossing with Egypt that is located here.
