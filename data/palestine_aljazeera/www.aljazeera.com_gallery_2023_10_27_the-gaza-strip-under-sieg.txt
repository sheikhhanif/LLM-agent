In the Six-Day War in 1967, Israel occupied the Gaza Strip and has ever since maintained a tight grip on it and the more than two million Palestinians who live there. By any measure, it has been awful.In 1987, Palestinians in Gaza and across the other occupied territories staged the first Intifada. To suppress the uprising, Israeli forces routinely beat protesters.In 2000, the second Intifada began with largely peaceful protests, but was met with what was widely condemned as excessive force by the Israeli military.Israel carried out its 'disengagement' plan in 2005, ordering Jewish settlers to leave Gaza while withdrawing the army to improve security, it said. However, strict Israeli control over Palestinians’ lives was still maintained.When Hamas took over Gaza in 2007, Israel imposed a blockade (still in place), and in late 2008, launched its first major assault on the enclave, Operation Cast Lead, which according to Israel was aimed at ending rocket attacks by Hamas. At least 920 Palestinian civilians were killed. Amnesty International called much of the destruction 'wanton'.In 2012, Israel launched another offensive, called Operation Pillar of Defence, which included air attacks and a ground operation. Over eight days, 87 civilians were killed, including 35 children and 14 women.Two years later, Israel launched Operation Protective Edge, which lasted 50 days and killed 1,462 Palestinian civilians and almost 500 children. Half a million people were displaced.Several grievances led to another Israel-Gaza conflict in May 2021, which lasted 11 days and killed at least 260 Palestinians, including 39 women and 67 children. Less than 15 months later, Israeli warplanes attacked for three days, killing at least 49 Palestinians, including 17 children.And now there’s yet another war, worse than anything seen so far, in which Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant has demonised Palestinians, while Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has threatened to turn the enclave into a 'deserted island'.RelatedIs­raeli bomb­ing lev­els a res­i­den­tial square on Gaza City’s Jalaa StreetYarmouk Square, and all its apart­ment build­ings, was tar­get­ed and de­stroyed by Is­raeli air raids.cameraPublished On 27 Oct 202327 Oct 2023Satel­lite im­ages show scale of de­struc­tion in Is­rael’s as­sault on GazaAc­cord­ing to the UN, at least 45 per­cent of all hous­ing units in the Gaza Strip have been dam­aged or de­stroyed.Published On 26 Oct 202326 Oct 2023Will un­con­di­tion­al US sup­port for Is­rael harm its ties with the Arab world?The US’s un­wa­ver­ing sup­port for Is­rael has ex­posed both dou­ble stan­dards and strate­gic short-sight­ed­ness, ob­servers say.Published On 27 Oct 202327 Oct 2023Is­rael con­ducts sec­ond ground raid into north­ern Gaza with air sup­portThe overnight in­cur­sion was backed by fight­er jets and drones that hit tar­gets in Shu­jaiya area, Is­rael’s army says.Published On 27 Oct 202327 Oct 2023More from  GalleryPhotos: Tears and joy as second batch of 39 Palestinian prisoners freedPhotos: Wounded patients left at al-Shifa Hospital face dire conditionsPhotos: Lebanese residents of border towns return home amid truce in GazaPhotos: Aid brings relief in Gaza amid Israel-Hamas truceMost ReadPalestinians gather on Ramallah streets after more prisoners releasedCalls to extend Gaza truce grow as more captives, detainees are exchangedThree Palestinian men shot in Vermont, US amid Israel-Hamas truceIndia vs Australia: Second T20 cricket match – as it happenedAboutShow moreAbout UsCode of EthicsTerms and ConditionsEU/EEA Regulatory NoticePrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyCookie PreferencesSitemapCommunity GuidelinesWork for usHR QualityConnectShow moreContact UsAdvertise with usAppsNewslettersChannel FinderTV SchedulePodcastsSubmit a TipOur ChannelsShow moreAl Jazeera ArabicAl Jazeera EnglishAl Jazeera Investigative UnitAl Jazeera MubasherAl Jazeera DocumentaryAl Jazeera BalkansAJ+Our NetworkShow moreAl Jazeera Centre for StudiesAl Jazeera Media InstituteLearn ArabicAl Jazeera Centre for Public Liberties & Human RightsAl Jazeera ForumAl Jazeera Hotel PartnersFollow Al Jazeera English:facebooktwitteryoutubeinstagram-colored-outlinerss© 2023 Al Jazeera Media Network
