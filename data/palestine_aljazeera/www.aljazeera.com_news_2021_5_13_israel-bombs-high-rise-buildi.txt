“A ground operation needs a lot of preparation, needs a lot of troops,” he said, noting that it is likely that there is not yet enough number of tanks, artillery and troops to enter Gaza.

Israeli air strike kills woman, three children
Al Jazeera correspondent Safwat al-Kahlout, reporting from Gaza, said a woman and her three children are the latest fatalities in the continuing Israeli air strikes on the Palestinian territory.
He said the bodies of the four victims have been retrieved by authorities, after an ambulance was initially prevented from reaching the site in northern Gaza due to the intense bombardment.
The latest fatalities are in addition to the 109 confirmed deaths including 28 children.
Kahlout also said that hospitals in Gaza are appealing for blood donations due to shortage after a “big wave” of injuries.
More families are also continuing to evacuate and seeking shelter at UN schools as the heavy Israeli bombardment continues.

Imagine having to decide whether to sleep your children in different areas of the house to increase the chance that at least one will survive or to huddle w/ them so you all die together. You cannot run and no place is safe as Israel’s bombs rain down. #Gaza

Palestinian-American congresswoman rips US leaders
Democratic US Representative Rashida Tlaib, the US Congress’s only Palestinian-American member, delivered an emotional speech on the House floor Thursday, slamming President Joe Biden and other top US leaders for offering statements that she says do not acknowledge what Palestinians are currently experiencing amid the Gaza fighting.
“To read the statements from President Biden, Secretary Blinken, General Austin and leaders of both parties, you would hardly know Palestinians existed at all,” Tlaib said.
“There has been no recognition of the attack on Palestinian families being ripped from their homes right now. No mention of children being detained or murdered. No recognition of a sustained campaign of harassment and terror by Israeli police against worshippers kneeling down and praying and celebrating the holiest days in one of their holiest places, no mention of Al Aqsa being surrounded by violence, tear gas, smoke, while people pray.”

Despite the crushing despair knowing that death is raining down once again on the people of Gaza, Rep. Rashida Tlaib should give us all hope. She is exactly where she was meant to be, saying exactly what must be said: Palestinian rights are human rights pic.twitter.com/NGHyGH5vFM

Israeli forces attack northern Gaza, hundreds driven from their homes
Al Jazeera correspondent Safwat al-Kahlout, reporting from Gaza, described a sudden and huge wave of Israeli attacks from the air, artillery and tanks concentrated in the north of the Gaza Strip.
“We could hear lots of explosions,” al-Kahlout said.
Following the Israeli attacks, there were calls for ambulances for people who were injured. Ambulance services had difficulty reaching the area because roads linking to the north were damaged by the Israeli bombardment, al-Kahlout said.
Hundreds of families were driven from their homes and forced to take shelter from the bombing, he said.

Israeli forces announce air and ground troops are attacking Gaza
In a statement on Twitter, the Israeli military said its forces are attacking Gaza.

IDF air and ground troops are currently attacking in the Gaza Strip.
— Israel Defense Forces (@IDF) May 13, 2021

Al Jazeera’s Harry Fawcett, reporting from southern Israel, described sounds of artillery being fired into Gaza and machine-gun fire from a helicopter as a column of Israeli armoured vehicles headed towards the border.
Fawcett saw “the first sort of major movement of heavy armour that we had seen so far. Tanks, tracked vehicles, heading in a line south towards Gaza at the same time as there was this extremely intensive artillery barrage lasting about an hour.”
It was unclear whether it was the start of a ground invasion, or the “warning of a potential” invasion, he said.

13 May 2021 - 20:32 GMT
Gaza-Israel operations continue
Reporting from southern Israel, Al Jazeera’s Harry Fawcett said that operations on both sides were still going on, but there has been a bit of a lull in terms of the most recent rocket fire out of Gaza.
“However, we are still hearing regularly artillery heading into Gaza from locations around here,” said Fawcett.
“Also in the last 10 minutes, the sound of machine-gun fire apparently coming from nearby. Helicopter[s] as well, and so the situation remains that this is a continuing military attack that the Israelis seem intent on continuing.
“What we saw earlier was the first of a major movement of heavy armour that we’ve seen so far, tanks, tracked vehicles, heading in a line south towards Gaza, at the same time there was this extremely intensive artillery barrage lasting about an hour, then there was a pause, and then another big artillery barrage coming later.
“It’s not yet clear whether this is a ground invasion, or whether it is a kind of a warning of the potential of a ground invasion. Either way, it is already having a devastating impact it seems in northern Gaza,” he added.

Israel shells north Gaza, destroys houses in the south
Al Jazeera’s Safwat Al Kahlout, reporting from Gaza City, said that in a new development Israel has begun firing barrages of artillery shells into the north of the Gaza Strip.
“Hundreds of families are now evacuating their homes in the north of Gaza because of the heavy artillery shells landing. The ambulance services told us that some of the artillery shells had directly hit some houses in the so-called Bedouin village which is very close to the border,” he said.
“It’s the same scenario of the war of 2014 when hundreds of families also evacuated their homes because of the random shooting.”
Al Kahlout said the Gaza ambulance service told Al Jazeera it has also received appeals for assistance from citizens in the south of the Gaza Strip, mainly in Rafah, as Israeli jets had destroyed houses in air raids without warning.
“They believe that there are lots of people under the rubble. So far, the ambulance services say they have managed to retrieve five bodies – including children and women – from one of the destroyed houses.”

United States President Joe Biden called for a de-escalation of violence in the Middle East as the conflict in Gaza intensified, saying he wants to see a significant reduction in rocket attacks.
Biden, speaking to reporters at the White House, also said he expects to have more talks with leaders in the region. He added that he has not seen “a significant overreaction” by Israel to rocket attacks by Hamas from Gaza.

Biden spoke on Wednesday with Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and said conversations were continuing between US diplomats, military and intelligence officers with counterparts in Israel, Egypt and Saudi Arabia and others about a de-escalation of violence.

“At 6pm, an air drone suddenly hit the building. Then came an air strike which landed on the apartment below. I had to flee right away because we expected a rocket next.
“I couldn’t take anything. The next day I returned for two minutes to try to get some clothes and medicine, but then they (Israel) hit again.
“Again, today I had to flee my grandparents’ house with all my family. All we can do is move from place to another place and try to convince ourselves that this time it will be safe. It’s been a nightmare.”

France’s interior minister asked police to ban a pro-Palestinian protest in Paris this weekend over the conflict with Israel, fearing a repeat of clashes during a similar situation in 2014.
Activists had called the protest in the Barbes district of northern Paris to demonstrate against Israel’s use of force in the Gaza Strip in response to rocket fire by the militant group Hamas.
“I have asked the Paris police chief to ban the protests on Saturday linked to the recent tensions in the Middle East,” Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin wrote on Twitter.
“Serious disturbances to public order were seen in 2014,” he added, urging police chiefs elsewhere in France to also remain vigilant over demonstrations.
In a circular seen by AFP, Darmanin also urged local police chiefs to assure the “protection of places of worship, schools, cultural centres and businesses of the Jewish community.”

“This started in 1948 with the establishment of the Israeli state and the colonisation of Palestine. So, it’s not correct to describe it (inter-communal violence) as a civil war. This situation is the continuation of a process that started a long time ago.

Palestinian families in the mixed Arab-Jewish city of Haifa told Al Jazeera Arabic that mobs of Jewish Israelis were marking the homes of the city’s Arab community on Wednesday night to help identify them.
Meanwhile, others used lethal force to attack Arabs in their homes while police forces stood by and watched.
“Hundreds if not thousands of settlers (Jewish Israelis) attacked Arab neighbourhoods in Haifa last night,” said Heba, an Arab resident of Haifa.
“They were asking where the Arabs live. They attacked us in our home with stones under the protection of the security forces. There were tens of police officers, cars and even horses. We had nothing to protect ourselves within our own homes,” she added.

“They are attacking all Arabs whether they are Muslim, Christian or Druze. We are terribly scared that they will come back and attack us in our homes and on the streets. We have nothing to protect ourselves against this state-sponsored violence.

Hamas’s armed wing, the al-Qassam Brigades, has warned Israel there are “no red lines if Al-Aqsa is violated”.
Spokesman Abu Obeida said the decision to bomb Dimona, Tel Aviv and other Israeli cities “is easier for us than drinking water”.
“We reassure our people that we have more rockets in our inventory, and our missile strikes have revealed the enemy’s fragility,” he said.
As Israel is preparing ground troops east of the Gaza Strip, Obeida said the Israeli army will sorely regret carrying out a ground invasion.
“Our weapons are for our land, for the defence of our people and victory for our sanctities,” the military spokesman said.
“What distinguishes this battle is the solidarity of the Palestinians across the country and their unanimous support for resistance.”

He specified the forces would be reservists from Israel’s border police, a force that largely operates in the occupied West Bank.

1,600 rockets fired from Gaza: Israel’s military
More than 1,600 rockets have been launched from Gaza at Israel since the latest flare-up of fighting began earlier this week, according to Israel’s military.
Around 400 of the rockets went down over Gaza, spokesman Jonathan Conricus said. The success rate of Israel’s Iron Dome aerial defence system continues to average around 90 per cent at intercepting rockets, he added.
Israel’s military has attacked around 600 targets in the Gaza Strip, including rocket production and storage facilities. A tunnel was also targeted that Conricus said was used partially to hide fighters and was built under a school in a populated area.

The Israeli army also said that it is going to present a plan for a ground operation for the political leadership, said Al Jazeera’s Harry Fawcett reporting from southern Israel, close to the border with the Gaza Strip.
“That doesn’t mean that it [the plan] will go ahead as a ground offensive in Gaza would be a huge escalatory step that carries with it a huge amount of risk,” he said.
Meanwhile, Fawcett reported that further rockets were fired out of Gaza in the course of the night adding that some reports said that more barrage will come through the day.
“So the escalatory nature of the situation remains pretty much in place.”

Fresh Israeli air raid on Rafah city
The city of Rafah in the southern Gaza Strip has been hit by a fresh Israeli air raid, while a barrage of rockets was launched from Gaza towards Israeli cities close to the enclave, Al Jazeera’s Nida Ibrahim, reporting from Ramallah, said.
“Gaza is a relatively small piece of land with two million Palestinians – one of the most condensed areas in the world so you can imagine the impact of these targets,” said Ibrahim.
“It is also such a closed zone the chances of hitting civilians gets very high as Palestinians can tell you from previous wars,” she added.

Muslim countries must show a united and clear stance over Israel’s conflict with the Hamas movement in Gaza, said Turkey’s Vice President Fuat Oktay as he criticised world powers for condemning violence without acting.
“What we desire is that active measures are taken,” Oktay told reporters after morning prayers marking the end of Ramadan.
“There are decisions taken repeatedly at the United Nations, there are condemnations. But unfortunately, no result has been obtained, because a clear stance is not displayed.”
