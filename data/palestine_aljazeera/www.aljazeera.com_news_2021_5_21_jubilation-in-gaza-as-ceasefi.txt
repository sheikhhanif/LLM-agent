On the Israeli side, 12 people, including two children, were killed.

‘No guarantees’ truce will hold, says top Palestinian diplomat
Riyad al-Maliki, the Palestinian foreign minister, told Al Jazeera “there are no guarantees” that the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas would hold.
“There are no guarantees at all. No guarantees at all. Because, Israel proclaims that the ceasefire is unilateral. That they have taken that decision on their own,” al-Maliki said in an exclusive interview.
But contrary to Israeli claims, Egypt, Qatar and the United Nations played important roles in negotiating the truce, he said.
“And all of them combined were able to get the consent of all parties to this fight and we got that that approval.”

Jordanians celebrate ‘victory of the resistance’
Thousands of people demonstrated on Friday in Jordan to celebrate the “victory of the resistance” against Israel.
Responding to a call by the Muslim Brotherhood, some 10,000 people, according to AFP journalists, gathered in the Sweimeh region near the border with the Israeli-occupied West Bank.
Demonstrators carried banners reading: “Jerusalem is the symbol of victory”, “congratulations on the victory of the resistance” and “the resilience of Gaza led to victory”.

As ceasefire holds, seasoned diplomat sees little hope for negotiations
Martin Indyk, a distinguished fellow with the Council on Foreign Relations, former US special envoy for Israeli-Palestinian negotiations, and US ambassador to Israel, told Al Jazeera on Friday he sees little room for diplomatic progress following the ceasefire between Israel and Palestinian armed groups in the besieged Gaza Strip.
Indyk said Hamas and Israel and are still opposed.
“Is there a potential for negotiation between Israel and the Palestinian Authority (PA)? Part of the problem … is we’ve been there, we’ve tried that. I myself was involved in the last effort in 2014. And it ended in failure.”

There's that word "equal" again in @potus Biden's remarks yesterday on the Middle East: "I believe the Palestinians and Israelis equally deserve to live safely and securely and to enjoy equal measures of freedom, prosperity, and democracy."  https://t.co/omAmXGx1oj
— Martin Indyk (@Martin_Indyk) May 21, 2021

Those efforts partly failed because the PA “was reluctant to make any type of concessions” with Israel that could be portrayed as a betrayal by Hamas.
Indyk said Palestinian youth, who are spearheading a nonviolent movement for equal rights in Israel and to be treated fairly under occupation in the West Bank, could find international favour.
“But I don’t see Palestinian leadership getting behind that,” Indyk said.

Correspondent: US support for Israel a ‘challenge’ for Biden
Al Jazeera’s White House correspondent Kimberly Halkett said on Friday that while President Joe Biden reaffirmed his support of Israel, that position is likely to raise further challenges.
“The challenge for Joe Biden is that many in his party see US support for Israel and not also for the Palestinians in equal measure to be somewhat … hypocritical and not in line with the sort of social justice” focus “this administration promised.
“So, as a result, the challenges to this White House are growing by the day”.

Biden says ‘no shift’ in commitment to Israel
US President Joe Biden said during a joint news conference at the White House with South Korean President Moon Jae-in, “There is no shift in my commitment, commitment to the security of Israel. Period. No shift, not at all.”
However, “we still need a two-state solution”, Biden said, callling it, “the only answer.”
Biden said Democrats still support Israel, even though high-profile progressives like Representatives Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Rashida Tlaib, whose family is from the occupied West Bank, have been critical of Israel.
He acknowledged Gaza needs help and said he is prepared “to attempt to put together a major package with other nations who share our view to rebuild the homes” destroyed in Gaza without “providing Hamas the opportunity to rebuild their weapon system”.

Immediate need for food, health, psychosocial support: UNRWA
The United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) has called for food, health and psychosocial support for Palestinians sheltering at UNRWA schools in Gaza. There are 65,000 displaced people in emergency UNRWA shelters.
“The ongoing 14-year long blockade of Gaza causes for the continued lack of medicine and aid, while physical distancing to prevent COVID-19 transmission remains almost impossible amid the ongoing internal displacement caused by the latest airstrikes,” it said in a statement.

Concerns have continued to mount over the deteriorating situation for Gaza residents, where power is only available for six to eight hours per day. This has disrupted the provision of healthcare and other basic services, including water, hygiene, and sanitation.

Fundamental political issues need to be addressed: UN
James Bays, Al Jazeera’s diplomatic editor, reporting from West Jerusalem says that the resolution calling for a ceasefire has now been rewritten with the focus on humanitarian access, and getting all humanitarian aid into Gaza.
The spokesperson for Secretary-General Antonio Guterres also said in New York at the UN headquarters that “fundamental political issues have to be addressed,” Bays said.
“The UN believes that is time now to look at the fundamental problems, and at the peace process.
“The big question is whether the US also shares that view because the Biden administration has been in office now for four months, and this – until the conflict erupted – was not one of the priorities. They were looking at Afghanistan, climate change, the Iran nuclear deal, and this long-running conflict was right down their list of priorities,” Bays said.

Gaza media building owner complains to ICC: Lawyer
The owner of a Gaza building housing international media that was destroyed in an Israeli air raid is lodging a complaint with the International Criminal Court, his lawyer has said.
The complaint by Jawad Mehdi says that the attack on May 15 which flattened al-Jala tower, housing the offices of US news agency Associated Press and Al Jazeera television, was a “war crime”.
The filing, a copy of which was seen by AFP, comes after the chief prosecutor of the ICC said last week that “crimes” may have been committed during the recent violence.
“The owner of this building, who is a Palestinian, has mandated his lawyers to file a war crime complaint with the International Criminal Court,” lawyer Gilles Devers said in a statement.

Political opponents questioning Netanyahu’s motives
In occupied East Jerusalem, Al Jazeera’s Hoda Abdel-Hamid says political opponents are questioning Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s motives to go to war.
“Some of them are saying that it was just because the prime minister … is politically in battle. He hasn’t been able to form any kind of coalition governments in four elections in less than two years, so he was trying to get some personal political gain through this war,” Abdel-Hamid said.
“Others say why did we [launch] this war since we didn’t finish it off. Some of the far-right groups would have preferred to see a ground invasion, would have preferred to see much more decisive action against Hamas.
“And then you have the military leadership … [who] are questioning what was the purpose of this military operation, and if Hamas was really weakened to the extent that is said.”

“Today, people were also celebrating and they had a sigh of relief that the war in Gaza is over, but the tensions are still very much there.”

“Muslim states must sincerely support the Palestinian people, through military … or financial support … or in rebuilding Gaza’s infrastructure,” Khamenei said in a statement carried by media outlets.
He urged Muslims to demand that their governments back Palestinians.

Muslim states should earnestly enter the field to support the Palestinian nation in both military and financial aspects as well as for reconstructing infrastructures and rebuilding the ruins in #Gaza. Muslim nations should demand that their governments carry out this duty.

UN urges calm at Al-Aqsa Mosque compound
At a UN briefing in New York, Stéphane Dujarric, spokesperson for UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said both sides must “show restraint” and that the status quo at the holy sites must be respected.
“In these situations, both political leaders, religious leaders have a responsibility to speak out against anyone who disrupts peace. And we should all stand firmly against incitement and violence, especially in such a tense environment,” Dujarric said.
It was unclear what sparked Friday’s violence at the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound. Police fired stun grenades and tear gas, and Palestinians hurled rocks after hundreds took part in a celebratory demonstration in which they waved Palestinian and Hamas flags. Israeli police said they arrested 16 people.

Members of the Jewish community and allies have gathered at the Israeli consulate in Toronto to protest against Israel’s violence in Gaza and across historic Palestine, Canadian organisations World Beyond War and Independent Jewish Voices (IJV) have said in a statement.
“This belligerence is the latest in an ongoing aggressive 73-year settler-colonisation project by Israel across historic Palestine,” Rabbi David Mivasair, a member of IJV said. “The ceasefire doesn’t end the injustice and oppression.”
Rabbi Mivasair quoted the Book of Genesis saying: “The voice of your brother’s blood cries out to Me from the earth.
“Canadian Jews and others joined today to make sure that cry is heard even if the blood stops being spilled anew. Red paint streaming from the Israeli consulate onto the street in Toronto represents the blood of massacred innocent Palestinian civilians, the blood on Israel’s hands. As Canadians, we demand that our government holds Israel accountable for war crimes and stops the Canada-Israel arms trade,” Mivasair said.

‘Several hundred’ pieces of unexploded ordnance in Gaza
Fabrizio Carboni, regional director for the Near and Middle East at the International Committee of the Red Cross, has estimated there are “several hundred” pieces of unexploded ordnance strewn about in Gaza and said medical supplies were a pressing need.
Matthias Schmale, Gaza director for UNRWA, the UN aid agency for Palestinian refugees, cited a “window” of several hours on Friday during which aid and supplies could be brought in through the Karem Abu Salem (Kerem Shalom in Hebrew) crossing point into Gaza.
Speaking by video from Gaza City, he noted that a central laboratory that carries out testing for COVID-19 had been “made dysfunctional by a massive bomb explosion”.
He said the ceasefire feels “fragile” and lamented the “unbearable and unacceptable cost this has had for the civilian population. And I know that applies to people in Israel, too.”

Ceasefire still fragile, but could hold: Analyst
According to Al Jazeera’s senior political analyst Marwan Bishara, the ceasefire is still fragile but for the time being, it could hold.
Details are still left to be worked out, “in the sense of how much will the Egyptians and others be able to survey the implementation of the ceasefire,” Bishara said.
“For the time being, this could hold. Unfortunately in terms of the deadlock, we are back where we were before the war, so you would wonder why the escalation in the first place, and what’s the point of yet another war when the results are … to be more of the same because we’ve already been at it three times before.
“For this to be repeated again this year with such a huge human cost is so counterproductive that you would wonder what must happen now for this not to be repeated, and as you would say some sort of a political solution.”

Storming of Al-Aqsa Mosque compound reflects a fragile ceasefire: Correspondent
Al Jazeera’s Hoda Abdel-Hamid, reporting from occupied East Jerusalem, says the storming of the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound by Israeli police was unexpected and reflects how fragile the ceasefire can be.
“The Israeli police say that some of the youth that were at the complex of Al-Aqsa were throwing stones at the Israeli police. However, Palestinians are saying that they had been harassed since the very early hours when they were arriving towards the mosque. They were surrounded by the police and they felt a lot of pressure,” Abdel-Hamid said.
“I think this is just telling about how things are going to go ahead and how fragile the ceasefire can be, in the sense that Hamas clearly said that it has gotten guarantees that there wouldn’t be any more tensions around the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound or in Sheikh Jarrah. That hasn’t materialised so far.”

Palestinians say they are happy with the general strike held on Tuesday as it united Palestinians living in Israel, in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem, she said.
“They were striking in one day which is the first time in decades that they were able to do that … many people tell us that it’s clear now that Israel doesn’t understand the language of peace, the language of negotiation, but rather the language of force.”

Celebrations in Gaza while ‘picking up the devastation’: Correspondent
Al Jazeera’s Harry Fawcett, reporting from Gaza, says the atmosphere in the strip is mixed.
“There is a genuine celebratory feeling because of what has happened, what Haniya was referring to as a victory, and he also referred to it as a first preparatory battle. There could be bigger battles for Jerusalem to come, so the idea of fighting a battle for Jerusalem still holds that kind of power over people, and they are celebrating,” Fawcett said.
“But they are also picking up the devastation of the last 11 days … there are homes all over Gaza that have been destroyed. The latest figures we have is 1,000 individual homes have been completely destroyed, 700 have been severely damaged, and another 14,000 home units have been partially damaged.
“[There is a] ratio of about more than six people per home in this town and in the strip, that’s more than 80,000 people who have lost their homes or had their homes seriously or partially damaged. That is a major catastrophe for this community.”

Haniya’s message ‘is exactly what people want to hear’
Youmna al-Sayed, reporting from Gaza, said Hamas leader Ismail Haniya’s address to Palestinians in Gaza aimed to make them feel better “despite the destruction around them”.
“For Ismail Haniya, he transfers the image that Hamas has won a great victory over Israel in this aggression and that the Palestinian resistance was up to the battle until the end, it was able to stand and [inflict] pain on the Israeli occupation.”
 




 


 
Haniya’s message that Hamas has won the battle in Gaza, Sheikh Jarrah and the Al-Aqsa Mosque, is something that “people really want to hear,” al-Sayed said.
“They want the Palestinian resistance to win in this aggression. After all, [many] have lost their homes and a lot of people were killed and injured and they don’t want all that to be in vain. This is exactly what people want to hear.”

Highlighting Thursday’s UN General Assembly meeting on the crisis, Erdogan said a “successful session” was held under the presidency of Volkan Bozkir, a Turkish diplomat, and with the attendance of Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu, as well as other foreign ministers who stand together on the issue.

Pro-Palestinian protest in Japan
Hundreds of demonstrators in Japan’s capital, Tokyo, gathered near the Israeli embassy to show their support for Palestinians.
“I live in Japan, so what can I do other than to come here to express myself from my heart? Today is a work day for me, but I gave up my work today because we have to come here,” Omar, an Algerian businessman, told Al Jazeera.
“The minimum thing we can do is to use our voices to tell them, ‘You are not alone’,” he said.

Save the Children urges blockade lifting
Save the Children welcomed the news of a ceasefire, but urged countries to address the causes of the latest escalation that killed 65 children in Gaza and two in Israel.
“An end to the fighting, does not mean an end to children’s suffering,” said Jason Lee, Save the Children’s country director in the occupied Palestinian territory.
“Many will live with the mental, emotional and physical scars all their lives. Steps must be taken to immediately lift the blockade, which has been the root cause of the persistent denial of the rights of children in Gaza,” said Lee.

‘Peace became a dream’
Leila Barhoum, a humanitarian worker and human rights advocate based in Gaza, said Palestinians are used to ceasefires.
“We always get to a ceasefire, it’s just a question of when and what will be the loss until then,” Barhoum told Al Jazeera.
“It’s really disappointing that only after 11 days the international community put out some efforts for the ceasefire to take place,” she said.
World leaders’ messages welcoming the truce are always the same, Barhoum argued, while a “strong effort” for a long lasting peace was never put in place.
“I try to remember a year when we had a good life, and I can’t trace one to go back to,” she said.  “So peace became a dream, even a theory, that we try to achieve,” she said.

Start of ceasefire like ‘first day of Eid’
Al Jazeera’s Youmna al-Sayed, reporting from Gaza City, said Palestinians began celebrating as soon as the ceasefire came into effect.
“They started cheering and cheering ‘God is Great’,” she said. “And for them today, it’s considered actually the first day of the Eid al-Fitr religious festival since the aggression started before the last day of Ramadan and they didn’t really get to celebrate Eid.”
Standing in the middle of ruins of a bombarded home, al-Sayed said displaced families had already returned from the United Nations-run schools they had taken shelter in “because of the very bad humanitarian conditions” they faced there.
“There was no water, no electricity and they went there taking nothing with them,” she said. “But these people now in these circumstances are compounded by the crisis of the very high poverty and unemployment rates in the Gaza Strip, as well as the restrictions in regards to the reconstruction materials that are allowed to enter the Strip. They have no alternative but to wait for the funding of the construction of their homes again.”

Hamas maintains ‘hands on trigger’ after ceasefire: Official
A Hamas official has told Reuters news agency that Israel must end its violations in occupied East Jerusalem and address damages from the bombardment of Gaza following the ceasefire, warning the group still has its “hands on the trigger”.
“It is true the battle ends today but Netanyahu and the whole world should know that our hands are on the trigger and we will continue to grow the capabilities of this resistance,” said Ezzat El-Reshiq, a member of the Hamas political bureau.
El-Reshiq said the movement’s demands also include protecting the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound and ending the forced expulsion of Palestinian families from their homes in East Jerusalem which he described as “a red line”.
“What comes after the battle of the ‘Sword of Jerusalem’ is not like what came before because the Palestinian people backed the resistance and know that the resistance is what will liberate their land and protect their holy sites,” El-Reshiq said.

Rebuilding a ‘daunting challenge’ for Gaza following ceasefire
Some people in Gaza who had been taking shelter in school buildings after their homes were damaged in Israeli raids began returning as soon as the ceasefire began, according to Al Jazeera’s Youmna al-Sayed who is reporting from Gaza.
But she said many residents had had their homes completely destroyed and the task of rebuilding the city would be a “daunting challenge” due to the closure of border crossings which has starved Gaza of crucial building materials, fuel and other necessities.
“We are talking about rebuilding a territory that was already suffering a dire economic situation, high unemployment and the coronavirus outbreak,” she said.
